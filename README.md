# Shopping List
This repository is my solution to frontendeval's [Shopping List prompt](https://frontendeval.com/questions/shopping-list).

## Requirements
- [x] Entering more than two characters in the input should show a list of partially matching items (starting with the same characters)
- [ ] Clicking an item in the list of partially matching items should add it to the list
- [ ] Adding the same item multiple times is allowed
- [ ] Pressing the 'X' next to an item should delete it from the list
- [ ] Pressing the '✓' next to an item should check it off (i.e. strikethrough text and partially grey out text/buttons)
- [ ] Pressing the '✓' next to a checked-off item should uncheck it again
- [ ] Pressing the '✓' next to a checked-off item should uncheck it again
- [ ] When hitting the API endpoint, be sure to debounce your input.
